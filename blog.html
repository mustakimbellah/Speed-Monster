                  The variables defined outside of any function or curly
                  brackets are known as global variables and have global scope.
                </td>
                <td>
                  Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope
                  can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly
                  brackets {}.

                  Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any
                  part of that program, any function or conditional state can
                  access that variable.
                </td>

                  It is not a good practice to use global variables when they
                  are not needed as every code block will have access to those
                  variables

                  The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous
                  programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread,
                  but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the
                  illusion of multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens
                  on the back-end.

                  The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the
                  operations in line to be executed. Whenever a function is
                  finished, it is popped from the stack.

                <td>
                  The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to
                  the stack for processing. It follows the queue data structure
                  to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations
                  should be sent for execution.

                  Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser
                  API. These are APIs built into the browser. Based on the
                  command received from the call stack, the API starts its own
                  single-threaded operation.
